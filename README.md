# REFLECT AI Framework v1.0

A globally grounded, role-based ethical reflection framework for teams building and deploying AI systems.

## 🔍 What is the REFLECT AI Framework?

The **REFLECT AI Framework v1.0** — *Responsible Evaluation Framework for Legal, Ethical, Compliance & Trust in AI* — was developed by the creator of the [AI Ethics Checker GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686972141ca081918f99a0a1e68345ce-ai-ethics-checker) to help product, data, legal, and business teams assess potential ethical risks before launching AI systems. It also includes an optional trauma-informed, ADA-conscious, and survivor-safety reflection mode for emotionally sensitive use cases (e.g., healthcare, education, social support, or HR).

This tool is designed as an internal-use reflection aid, especially for organizations navigating responsible AI practices in environments where user vulnerability, regulatory scrutiny, or ethical ambiguity may arise.

It draws from globally accepted standards, including:
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- EU AI Act
- OECD AI Principles
- IEEE Ethically Aligned Design

This framework is designed to be practical, structured, and empowering — not judgmental or overly academic.

## 📂 Framework Categories

The REFLECT AI Framework guides reflection across six core categories. If enabled, trauma- and accessibility-aware prompts are embedded within each category to surface additional ethical considerations for vulnerable users or high-impact settings.

| Category                        | Icon | Description                             |
|--------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------|
| Fairness & Bias                | 🎯   | Equity across demographics and access   |
| Privacy & Consent              | 🔐   | Informed consent, data protection       |
| Transparency & Explainability  | 🔍   | Clarity on how decisions are made       |
| Accountability                 | 👤   | Responsibility for outcomes             |
| Legal & Regulatory Risk        | ⚖️   | Exposure to laws and compliance gaps    |
| Social & Environmental Impact  | 🌍   | Societal effects, sustainability        |

| 👤 Accountability          | ⚠️ Medium  | Responsibility is unclear if system fails      |
| ⚖️ Legal & Regulatory Risk | ❌ High    | May trigger “high-risk” status under EU AI Act |
| 🌍 Social & Environmental  | ✅ Low     | Minimal societal impact and low resource usage |

**Risk Level Key:**  
✅ Low • ⚠️ Medium • ❌ High

# REFLECT AI Framework v1.0

A globally grounded, role-based ethical reflection framework for teams building and deploying AI systems. Trauma-informed, accessibility-conscious, and built for real-world impact.

## 🔍 What is the REFLECT AI Framework?

The **REFLECT AI Framework v1.0** — *Responsible Evaluation Framework for Legal, Ethical, Compliance & Trust in AI* — is a practical, structured reflection method for product, data, legal, UX, and business teams. It helps teams identify and mitigate ethical risks before launching AI systems, especially in sensitive domains such as healthcare, HR, education, or social services.

Developed by the creator of the [REFLECT AI Ethics Checker GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686972141ca081918f99a0a1e68345ce-ai-ethics-checker), this framework includes an optional trauma-informed, ADA-conscious, and survivor-safety reflection mode to help teams account for accessibility, user harm, and psychological risk in emotionally complex settings.

This tool is designed as an internal-use reflection aid, especially for organizations navigating responsible AI practices in environments where user vulnerability, regulatory scrutiny, or ethical ambiguity may arise.

## 🌍 What Makes This Framework Unique?
Unlike technical “self-reflection” methods for LLMs or robotics, the REFLECT AI Framework is built for human teams designing real-world AI systems—with practical prompts, role-specific outputs, and actionable categories.

It draws from globally recognized standards, including:
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- EU AI Act
- OECD AI Principles
- IEEE Ethically Aligned Design

This framework is designed to be empowering, not punitive—focusing on practical reflection, transparency, and repair.

## 📂 Framework Categories

The REFLECT AI Framework guides reflection across six core categories. If enabled, trauma- and accessibility-aware prompts are embedded within each category to surface additional ethical considerations for vulnerable users or high-impact settings.

| Category                          | Icon | Description                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Fairness & Bias**               | 🎯   | Equity across demographics and access |
| **Privacy & Consent**             | 🔐   | Informed consent, data protection     |
| **Transparency & Explainability** | 🔍   | Clarity on how decisions are made     |
| **Accountability**                | 👤   | Responsibility for outcomes           |
| **Legal & Regulatory Risk**       | ⚖️   | Exposure to laws and compliance gaps  |
| **Social & Environmental**        | 🌍   | Societal effects, long-term impact    |

| Category                   | Risk Level | Notes                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Fairness & Bias         | ⚠️ Medium  | No demographic testing yet                     |
| 🔐 Privacy & Consent       | ✅ Low      | Opt-in and deletion supported                  |
| 🔍 Transparency            | ❌ High     | No explanation mechanism for users             |
| 👤 Accountability          | ⚠️ Medium  | Responsibility is unclear if system fails      |
| ⚖️ Legal & Regulatory Risk | ❌ High     | May trigger “high-risk” status under EU AI Act |
| 🌍 Social & Environmental  | ✅ Low      | Minimal societal impact and low resource usage |

**Risk Level Key:**  
✅ Low • ⚠️ Medium • ❌ High
